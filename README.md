## Quick Start

From the root of your Hugo site, clone the theme into `themes/AllinOne` by running:

```sh
# Clone theme into the themes/AllinOne directory
$ git clone https://github.com/EliiseS/AllinOne.git themes/AllinOne
```

## Usage

### Configuration

Please see the sample [`config.toml`](https://github.com/EliiseS/AllinOne/blob/master/exampleSite/config.toml). The latest Hugo version this theme has been built on is `0.92.0`.

If you use this as a theme of your project website (not the root directory),make sure not to use a forward slash `/` in the beginning of a `PATH` in your `config.toml`, `img` in your post head and `url` in your data directory, because Hugo will turn it into a relative URL and the `absURL` function will have no effect.

### Carousel Picture

Set two parameters in `config.toml`, `slidesDirPath` and `slidesDirPathURL`.

`slidesDirPath` sets the directory path for Hugo server to search. `slidesDirPathURL` sets the rel url for the images.

Here are simple examples for quick start.

```toml
# if you want to use images in the theme (defult in the theme)
slidesDirPath    = "themes/AllinOne/static/img/header-slides"  
slidesDirPathURL = "img/header-slides"

# if you want to use images in static/img/header-slides
slidesDirPath  = "static/img/header-slides"  
slidesDirPathURL = "img/header-slides"
```

### Post Intro Picture

List the image path in the `YAML` head of the post. For example:

```YAML
---
date: "2018-08-13T00:14:19+08:00"
publishdate: "2018-08-13+08:00"
lastmod: "2018-08-13+08:00"
draft: false
title: "This is an example"
tags: ["css", "blog"]
series: ["Example"]
categories: ["Sci"]
img: "images/blog/2018-08/test5.jpg"
toc: true
summary: "This is an example of adding an intro picture to the post. "
---

```

### Post Summary

There are three ways to add summary to each post.

- [Hugo-defined Summary Split](https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/)

  By default, Hugo automatically takes the first 70 words of your content as its summary and stores it into the `.Summary` page variable for use. It is much easier with no additional work, but it might not the one you want.

  If Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) languages are in the content, set `hasCJKLanguage` as `true` in the `config.toml`, so that Hugo could auto detect CJK languages to make `.Summary` and `.WordCount` behave correctly. [See here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration)

  The length of text to show in a `.Summary` could be set as `summaryLength` in `config.toml`. [See here](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/configuration/)

- [User-defined Summary Split](https://gohugo.io/content-management/summaries/)

  Alternatively, you may add the \<!--more--\> summary divider where you want to split the article. Content that comes before the summary divider will be used as that contentâ€™s summary and stored in the `.Summary` page variable with all HTML formatting intact. The only extra work is add the \<!--more--\> summary divider.

- User-defined Summary

  You may want a specific summary for the post other than the front sentences of the content. In this case, you could but summary in the yaml head of the post with the parameter `summary`.

### Series Intro Picture

By default, the series recommendation card list in the sidebar use `themes/AllinOne/static/img/default.png` as intro picture. You can set `name`, `img`, and `summary` in `data/series.toml`. `name` of the series should be in lower capitals. If the series cannot be found in `series.toml`, `default.png` will be used.

Here is an example of `data/series.toml`:

```TOML
[[series]]
name = "review repo"
img = "images/blog/2018-08/test3.jpg"
summary = "This is the place I write reviews"

[[series]]
name = "blog diary"
img = "images/blog/2018-08/test5.jpg"
summary = "How I build up my personal website"
```
